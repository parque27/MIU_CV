## Introduction
This project consists of a reduced version of my (real) CV. Here, I have provided the information I have on my real CV and I have structured in a manner which is similar to the CV I often present to job offers.
However, I have ommited sensitive information such as my real phone number.

## User persona
The target user persona would be someone interested in my professional and academic career. This include profiles such as job recruiters. In the next section, I explain the main areas I focus, which are academics, job positions and a little bit of myself. This user would carefully read through these sections and gather all the necessary information. This recruiter persona would not be restricted to a IT/CGI position, because I haven't fully adapted this CV to be an engineering/CS CV.

## Designing the architecture
The initial idea was to mimic my real CV, with the same sections, banners, sidebars and imagery. However, due to several reasons (read "Autocritic") I've ommited entire sections, although most of the structure is preserved. 
When I first designed the CV, I wanted to focus on three things:
* To show my academic degrees, current and past.
* To explain what positions I've had in the past. That includes listing the most important things I learnt / did during the experience.
* To explain a little bit about myself, my soft skills and some useful information, such as the languages I speak or any minor certificate/license.

I added the "volunteering" section, which consists (mainly) of my experience in college politics and national student representation.
So, to sum up, I tried to mimic those things using blocks of information to show the user all the information they would need or be interested into.

## Designing the CV
To design the CV, I initially tried to do something cool, but in the end I ended up mimicking my current CV. Not only I couldn't fully replicate my CV, but it also lacked a lot of things, due to reasons exposed in the next paragraph. However, the "blue" theme of the CV was preserved. The color blue is often associated with serenity, seriousness and calm, so when I first decided the general theme of the CV I opted for a more neutral, business-themed CV rather than a joyful and playful CV. Note that the font does not follow this principle, because I wanted to balance the theme of the CV with the content of it, so it could already tell something about me just by looking at it; I am someone serene, but not boring. That was kind of the idea.

## Autocritic
This CV has not taken me a long time to make; I postponed the task until the last moment, and the end result is not as good as I would have wanted it to be. Luckily, I had a _good_ reference to begin creating the CV (my own) but I could have re-imagined it as something better, more optimised and with more character. Due to bad organization, it has turned out to be a rushed, mediocre project, with a rather poorly written Engilsh (despite claiming I've attained the C1 level) and a code with little imagination. I have watched some tutorials on how to do some things, and I have asked some questions at our _not_ so trusty ChatGPT, and the end result is the patched version of a project that could have been way better. For the next project, I will try like to put a little bit more effort, a litte more of my _personal_ touch and imagination (and better grammar!).
